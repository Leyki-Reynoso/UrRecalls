							<a href="single.html" title="">The Archaic Anatomy of Product Recalls</a>
						</h2>

					<div class="entry-content">
						<p><br>For the average consumer, keeping current on product recalls, requires consulting several agencies, from the FDA, (Food and drug Association), the USDA (US Department of Agriculture), the NHTSA (National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration) and CPSC (Consumer Product and Safety Commission), in addition to allergy websites. A critical fact most consumers don't realize is that recalls are voluntary, "rarely does the FDA request a recall..."
						<br><br> Instead, a recall is initiated when the company reports a discovery to the FDA, the FDA discovers a problem during an inspection, or the FDA receives reports of health issues from various reporting systems/sources including from the CDC. When you consider that the majority of product recalls are voluntary, and costs an average of $10 million, as per a recent GMA study, how confident are you that this self-regulation is adequate? Further, during the recent government shutdown, these inspections simply did not occur. Frightening, given the vast amount of imported products in our supply chain.
						<br><br> Lastly, if consumers suspected a product caused their illness, where, and to whom, would they report? <br>

We quickly realized the need for such a repository as inquiries flooded our inbox, a sample below:</p>

						<p> <br>The FDA's website that disseminates recall alerts doesn't rely on the barcode, nor any other standardized format, but utilizes product name, and other descriptive data to determine product ID, making it difficult to adequately capture incidence rate that might warrant FDA investigation. Further, absent standardization, determining whether a product you purchased is the same lot, expiration date, size, etc, of the recalled item requires scrutiny of several product announcements. 

						<br><br>How much safer would you feel if there were a simple means to receive alerts for only the products that concern you? And a standardized means of reporting products you suspected or deemed harmful?</p>

						<p> <br>No more lookups to numerous consumer websites; simply register, and scan or input your products manually. Urrecalls alerts its subscribers to any product in their device's history that is subsequently recalled. 

						<br><br>If you suspect a product may be the cause of an adverse reaction, you can submit a report, along with reports of products that break, malfunction, or turn hazardous. We harness crowdsourcing to afford safety in numbers.
